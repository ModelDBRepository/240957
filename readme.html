This is the readme for the model associated with figure 15 from the paper:<p/>

This model was contributed by S Appukuttan.  It is written in the NEURON simulator which is freely available from<br/>
<a href="http://neuron.yale.edu">http://neuron.yale.edu</a><p/>
<p/>If you need more help than given below in running the simulation please consult this page:<br/>
<a href="https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide.cshtml">https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide.cshtml</a><p/>
Usage:<br/>
------<br/>
Auto-launch from modeldb (if NEURON installed and the browser is configured) or download and extract the archive and start with a command like<p/>
nrngui init.hoc
<p/>on unix/linux, or start the init.hoc file on mswin or mac os x.<p/>
Click the RunAll button.  After a minute the simulation completes
and a figure similar to figure 15 in the paper is displayed:<p/>
<img src="./nrnscreenshot.png" alt="nrn screenshot" width="550">
<p/>Also a file called PeakDepol.dat will be created which you can graph with your favorite graphing program.  The matlab program included in this archive:<br/>
plotDepolarization.m<br/>
was used to make the publication figure 15.  It requires a program fixPSlinestyle.m from the matlab file exchange to re-write an output fig.eps file however will generate a figure onscreen without it.
The graph generated should look like this:<p>

<p/> 20180604 S Appukuttan contributed the matlab plotting program plotDepolarization.m
<p/> 20180605 S Appukuttan updated the neuron graph colors to match the matlab plot.
